# Storybook Test Automation

This GitHub Actions workflow automates Storybook testing. It checks out the code, configures the environment, builds Storybook, serves it, runs tests using Playwright, and publishes the results as a JUnit report. The results are uploaded for review using the publish-unit-test-result-action. This workflow ensures that all changes are tested and results are easily accessible within GitHub.
